<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 02/04/2026</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how we handle information in the applications developed by <strong>SQUADRATECH SOFTWARES</strong> (“developer”). We have a strict commitment to transparency, security, and privacy protection.</p>

<p>This application was designed following the <strong>Privacy by Design</strong> principle and complies with the following legislations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>General Data Protection Law – LGPD (Law No. 13.709/2018 – Brazil)</li>
  <li>General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 – European Union)</li>
  <li>California Consumer Privacy Act – CCPA and California Privacy Rights Act – CPRA (United States)</li>
</ul>

<h2>1. Personal Data Collection by the Developer</h2>
<p>The developer does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information from users, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>Email address</li>
  <li>Phone number</li>
  <li>Contact list</li>
  <li>Precise geographic location (GPS)</li>
  <li>Documents or sensitive data</li>
</ul>
<p>The application is designed to function without direct user identification, with most functionalities being executed locally on the device. Internet connection occurs only for technical and advertising purposes, as described in this policy.</p>

<h2>2. Third-Party Services and Advertising (Google AdMob)</h2>
<p>To keep the application free, we use the Google AdMob advertising service, provided by Google LLC. Although the developer does not have direct access to personal data, the Google AdMob SDK may automatically process certain technical information for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ad serving</li>
  <li>Performance measurement and analysis</li>
  <li>Technical diagnosis (crash logs)</li>
  <li>Security and fraud prevention</li>
  <li>Legal compliance</li>
</ul>

<p>Data that may be processed by Google includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Advertising identifiers: Android Advertising ID (GAID) or iOS IDFA</li>
  <li>Technical information: device model, operating system, language, screen resolution</li>
  <li>Network and connectivity information</li>
  <li>Interaction data: ad views and clicks</li>
  <li>Approximate location: inferred from the IP address (not precise GPS location)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>📌 Google LLC acts as the controller of personal data processed through Google AdMob and is solely responsible for its collection, use, storage, and protection.</strong></p>
<p>The developer does not have direct access, control, or the ability to identify this data. If technical information is processed by third-party services such as Google AdMob, it occurs in accordance with Google's compliance policies and applicable laws.</p>

<h2>3. Legal Basis for Data Processing (LGPD and GDPR)</h2>
<p>The data processing carried out by third-party services is based on the following legal grounds:</p>
<ul>
  <li>User consent, when required (especially for personalized ads)</li>
  <li>Legitimate interest, for security, fraud prevention, diagnosis, and maintenance of the free service</li>
  <li>Compliance with legal and regulatory obligations</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. User Rights (LGPD and GDPR)</h2>
<p>Users located in Brazil and the European Union have rights guaranteed by law, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Confirmation of the existence of data processing</li>
  <li>Access to data</li>
  <li>Correction or update</li>
  <li>Deletion, anonymization, or blocking</li>
  <li>Limitation or opposition to processing</li>
  <li>Data portability, where applicable</li>
</ul>
<p>Since technical and advertising data are handled by Google AdMob, the exercise of these rights must be carried out directly with Google, according to its Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>5. Consent for European Union Users (EEA)</h2>
<p>For users located in the European Economic Area (EEA), where required by applicable law, consent for personalized advertisements will be requested before displaying ads, through tools provided by Google, such as the User Messaging Platform (UMP).</p>

<h2>6. Privacy Rights – United States (CCPA/CPRA)</h2>
<p>For users located in the United States, especially in the State of California:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The developer does not sell personal data for monetary value.</li>
  <li>The use of advertising identifiers by third-party services may be characterized as “sharing” for advertising purposes, as defined by CCPA/CPRA.</li>
  <li>Users can exercise the right to opt-out of this sharing through the operating system's privacy settings or as described in Google's policies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. How to Manage Your Privacy</h2>
<p>The user can manage ad personalization and advertising identifiers directly in the operating system:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings > Google > Ads</li>
  <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Data Retention and Security</h2>
<p>Technical data collected by third-party services, such as Google AdMob, are stored and retained exclusively by Google, in accordance with its own retention and security policies. Communication between the application and external servers occurs through encrypted protocols (HTTPS/SSL).</p>
<p>Despite the adoption of good security practices, no system is completely free of risks. The developer is not responsible for incidents resulting from external factors outside their direct control, including failures in third-party services.</p>

<h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Our applications are not directed at children under 13 (or the minimum legal age applicable in the user's jurisdiction). We do not intentionally collect data from children. If technical information is processed by third-party services, it occurs in accordance with Google's compliance policies and applicable laws, including child protection standards such as COPPA.</p>

<h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
